## Presentation Tips

### For Delivering the Presentation:

1. **Start with Impact:** Slide 1 sets the scene. Emphasize the scale: 73 miles, 6-8 years to build, 15,000 soldiers.

2. **Focus on Bias:** When showing Latin sources (Slides 2-9), really dig into word choices:
   - Why "barbaros" instead of neutral term?
   - Who's missing from these accounts? (British voices!)

3. **Use the Animation:** Slide 11 is your visual centerpiece. Click through all four phases to show how complex the construction was.

4. **Archaeological Evidence:** Slide 14's comparison grid is crucial—shows you're thinking critically, not just accepting Roman propaganda.

5. **Both Perspectives:** Slide 15 shows you understand both sides—not just "Rome bad, Britons good" but complex colonial relationship.

6. **Modern Connection:** Slide 16 brings it home—why this 1900-year-old wall still matters today.
