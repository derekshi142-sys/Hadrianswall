## PROVIDED SOURCE (Given by Teacher)

### Source 1: Historia Augusta - The Wall's Purpose
**Latin:** *Britanniam muro separavit, qui barbaros Romanosque divideret.*

**Translation:** "He separated Britain with a wall, to divide the barbarians from the Romans."

**Citation:** Historia Augusta, Life of Hadrian 11.2

**Context:** Written c. 300 AD (about 180 years after Hadrian's death), this biography is notoriously unreliable, mixing fact with fiction. The author is unknown.

**Guiding Questions:**
- What does this short line suggest was the purpose of Hadrian's Wall?
- How might this statement be propaganda rather than fact?
- How does archaeological evidence (the remains of Hadrian's Wall today) support or challenge this account?

**Detailed Analysis (Focus: "barbaros"):**
The use of *"barbaros"* (barbarians) reveals Roman bias and propaganda. This loaded term portrays the Britons as uncivilized outsiders, justifying Roman military presence. The word creates a clear "us vs. them" narrative—Romans as civilized, Britons as savage. This binary division oversimplifies the complex relationship between Romans and native Britons, many of whom served in Roman auxiliary forces and traded with the empire. Archaeological reality shows the wall had numerous gates (milecastles every Roman mile), suggesting it controlled movement rather than creating absolute separation—more about taxation and regulation than pure division.

## ADDITIONAL SOURCES (4 more to reach 5 total from teacher's document)

### Source 2: Cassius Dio - Hadrian's Provincial Reforms
**Latin:** *Circumeunti provincias multa correxit, multa mutavit.*

**Translation:** "While touring the provinces, he corrected many things and changed many things."

**Citation:** Cassius Dio, Roman History 69.9

**Context:** Cassius Dio was a Roman senator and historian writing in Greek around 200-220 AD, about 80-100 years after Hadrian. Generally considered more reliable than Historia Augusta.

**Guiding Questions:**
- What does this tell us about Hadrian's approach to governing the empire?
- How does this relate to his decision to build a defensive wall?
- What does the word "correxit" (corrected) imply about previous policies?

**Analysis:**
The verbs *"correxit"* (corrected) and *"mutavit"* (changed) show Hadrian's hands-on approach and suggest previous policies were flawed. This contextualizes the wall: not expansion but consolidation. Hadrian abandoned his predecessor Trajan's conquests in the East, showing pragmatism over glory-seeking—a controversial move. The wall represents this defensive strategy, fixing the empire's northern boundary rather than endless conquest.

### Source 3: Centurial Stone Inscriptions - The Builders
**Latin:** *LEG II AVG FEC*

**Translation:** "The Second Augustan Legion made this."

**Citation:** Inscription found on wall stones (multiple examples throughout the wall)

**Context:** These are primary sources from the actual construction period (122-128 AD). Hundreds of these stones survive, marking sections built by different centuries (units of ~80 men) within the three legions.

**Guiding Questions:**
- What does this inscription tell us about who built the wall?
- Why would legions inscribe their work?
- What does this reveal about Roman military organization?

**Analysis:**
These "centurial stones" mark sections built by specific legionary centuries, showing competition and pride in workmanship. Three legions built the wall: Legio II Augusta, Legio VI Victrix, and Legio XX Valeria Victrix. The abbreviation "FEC" (fecit - made) is a declaration of achievement. Roman soldiers weren't just fighters—they were engineers, surveyors, and builders. This multi-tasking capability made Rome's military unique and explains how they could undertake massive construction projects in remote frontiers.

### Source 4: Vindolanda Tombstone - Human Cost
**Latin:** *D M ANNIVS DAVICVS MILITAVIT ANNOS XXV VIXIT ANNOS XLV*

**Translation:** "To the spirits of the departed. Annius Davicus, served 25 years, lived 45 years."

**Citation:** Tombstone inscription, Vindolanda (fort near the wall)

**Context:** Primary source from the wall period. Typical Roman military tombstone format. Found at Vindolanda, one of the best-preserved forts associated with the wall.

**Guiding Questions:**
- What does this tombstone reveal about life on the frontier?
- What can we learn from the soldier's name and age?
- How does this personalize the history of the wall?

**Analysis:**
This tombstone humanizes the wall's story. The soldier's Celtic name (Davicus) suggests he was a local Briton serving Rome—many auxiliaries were recruited from conquered peoples. He spent his entire adult life (20-45) in military service on this harsh frontier. "D M" (Dis Manibus - to the spirits of the dead) shows Roman religious practices survived even in remote Britain. These inscriptions remind us that the wall wasn't just stone—it was built and manned by real people who lived, worked, and died there.

### Source 5: Vindolanda Tablet - Daily Life
**Latin:** *Cetera mitto tibi... subligaria duo... tunicam... cervicellas duas*

**Translation:** "I send you other items... two pairs of underpants... a tunic... two pairs of socks"

**Citation:** Vindolanda Tablet 346

**Context:** One of the famous Vindolanda tablets—thin wooden writing tablets preserved in waterlogged soil. These date from 85-122 AD (pre-wall construction, but same frontier). They provide unparalleled insight into daily Roman military life.

**Guiding Questions:**
- What does this mundane letter reveal about conditions at the wall?
- How does this contrast with epic historical narratives?
- What can we learn about supply lines and daily life?

**Analysis:**
This remarkably preserved wooden tablet shows the unglamorous reality of frontier life. A soldier's family sends warm clothing—Northern Britain was brutally cold for Mediterranean troops. The word *"cetera"* (other things) suggests regular supply requests. These tablets (hundreds found at Vindolanda fort near the wall) include birthday party invitations, supply lists, and complaints—they're time capsules showing soldiers were homesick, cold, and worried about mundane things like everyone else. This contrasts sharply with propaganda's heroic narratives.

## STUDENT-RESEARCHED SOURCES (3 additional sources required)

### Source 6: Hadrian's Military Management Style
**Latin:** *Exercitum per centuriones ac tribunos militares quam per legatos habebat disciplinae firmioris.*

**Translation:** "He kept the army through centurions and military tribunes rather than through legates, as it was more firmly disciplined."

**Citation:** Historia Augusta, Life of Hadrian 10.2

**Context:** Same source as Source 1 (Historia Augusta), so same reliability concerns apply—written 180+ years after events, possibly mixing fact and propaganda.

**Guiding Questions (Student-Created):**
- What does this reveal about Hadrian's management style for the wall project?
- How would this hands-on approach affect construction quality?
- Why would he trust junior officers over senior commanders?
- What does "disciplinae firmioris" suggest about his priorities?

**Detailed Analysis (Focus: "disciplinae firmioris"):**
The genitive phrase *"disciplinae firmioris"* (of firmer discipline) is key to understanding the wall's construction. Hadrian's micromanagement ensured consistent standards across 73 miles. Using centurions (experienced sergeants) and tribunes rather than high-ranking legates meant practical builders, not aristocrats, led the work. This explains the wall's remarkable engineering consistency—same dimensions, regular spacing of milecastles and turrets. However, it also suggests Hadrian didn't trust the senatorial class, creating political tensions back in Rome.

### Source 7: Land Confiscation for the Wall
**Latin:** *Agrum publicum per omnes provincias aut occupatum a privatis aut vacua possessione interceptum recepit.*

**Translation:** "Throughout all the provinces, he reclaimed public land that had been seized by private individuals or taken through vacant possession."

**Citation:** Historia Augusta, Life of Hadrian 11.4

**Context:** Again from Historia Augusta, so treat with caution. However, land seizure was standard Roman practice for military construction, so this is likely accurate in general.

**Guiding Questions (Student-Created):**
- How does this relate to acquiring land for the wall?
- What does "occupatum a privatis" suggest about Roman-British land relations?
- How might this policy have affected local British landowners?
- Was this legal confiscation or theft from the British perspective?

**Detailed Analysis (Focus: "occupatum a privatis"):**
The phrase *"occupatum a privatis"* (seized by private individuals) has sinister implications for Britain. From Rome's view, this reclaims "public" land. From Britons' perspective, this is confiscation of ancestral territory for the wall's construction. The wall required not just the footprint but a military zone stretching miles on either side. The passive verb "occupatum" (seized/occupied) ironically describes Roman actions—they're the real occupiers. British farms, villages, and sacred sites would have been destroyed for the wall, creating resentment that lasted generations.

### Source 8: British Resistance to Roman Occupation
**Latin:** *Britanni tolerare ultra nequirent Romanorum iniurias.*

**Translation:** "The Britons could no longer endure the injustices of the Romans."

**Citation:** Cassius Dio, Roman History 62.1

**Context:** This quote is actually about Boudicca's Revolt in 60-61 AD, about 60 years BEFORE the wall was built. However, it illustrates ongoing tensions between Romans and Britons that continued through the wall period. Cassius Dio is a generally reliable source.

**Guiding Questions (Student-Created):**
- Though written about an earlier revolt, how does this apply to the wall period?
- What does "iniurias" (injustices) specifically refer to?
- How might the wall itself have been seen as an "iniuria" by Britons?
- What evidence do we have of British resistance to the wall?

**Detailed Analysis (Focus: "tolerare ultra nequirent"):**
The phrase *"tolerare ultra nequirent"* (could no longer endure) captures the breaking point of oppression. While Dio writes about Boudicca's earlier revolt (60-61 AD), similar tensions existed during wall construction. *"Iniurias"* (injustices/outrages) is a loaded word—it includes taxation, land seizure, forced labor, and cultural suppression. The wall required thousands of workers; did Britons provide forced labor? Archaeological evidence shows northern tribes were displaced, villages abandoned. The wall literally divided families and disrupted trade routes—a massive "iniuria" that reshaped British life permanently.

## Tips for Citing These in Your Presentation

When discussing these sources in class:
1. **Identify the source type:** Literary (Historia Augusta, Cassius Dio) vs. Epigraphic (inscriptions on stones/tablets)
2. **Note the date gap:** Most literary sources written 80-200 years after events
3. **Consider bias:** All are Roman perspectives—no British voices
4. **Use archaeology:** Always compare what sources claim vs. what physical evidence shows
5. **Show critical thinking:** Question word choices like "barbaros" and "iniurias"
