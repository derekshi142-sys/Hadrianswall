# 🚀 Deploy Your Hadrian's Wall Presentation to Netlify

Your presentation is now **100% ready** for Netlify deployment!

## ✅ What's Been Done

- ✅ Renamed `hadrians_wall_presentation.html` → `index.html` (Netlify default)
- ✅ Created `netlify.toml` configuration file
- ✅ Pushed all changes to GitHub
- ✅ Repository: https://github.com/derekshi142-sys/Hadrianswall.git

## 📋 Deploy in 3 Steps (Takes ~2 minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Netlify
1. Visit **[netlify.com](https://netlify.com)**
2. Click **"Sign up"** (or "Log in" if you have an account)
3. Sign up with GitHub (easiest option)

### Step 2: Import Your Repository
1. Click **"Add new site"** button (top right)
2. Select **"Import an existing project"**
3. Choose **"Deploy with GitHub"**
4. Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub (one-time)
5. Find and select: **`derekshi142-sys/Hadrianswall`**

### Step 3: Deploy (Auto-configured!)
1. Netlify will show build settings:
   - **Build command:** (leave empty - no build needed!)
   - **Publish directory:** `.` (already configured in `netlify.toml`)
2. Click **"Deploy site"**
3. Wait ~30 seconds ⏱️
4. Done! 🎉

## 🌐 Your Live Site

After deployment, Netlify gives you a URL like:
```
https://rainbow-unicorn-abc123.netlify.app
```

You can customize this name:
1. Go to **Site settings** → **Change site name**
2. Try: `hadrians-wall-presentation` or your own name
3. Your URL becomes: `https://hadrians-wall-presentation.netlify.app`

## 🔄 Automatic Updates

**Best part:** Any time you push changes to GitHub, Netlify automatically redeploys!

```bash
# Make changes to index.html
git add -A
git commit -m "Updated slide content"
git push
# Netlify auto-deploys in ~30 seconds!
```
